until version "project + clock", there was a bug by clicking on a front-faced card. That bug was fixed on the subsequent versions.

I let more than one card per line on the media query on purpose, because i think it is better than the original project.

I let always 2 equal rows of cards as a matter of design.

I create one intermediary media query because the clock was in front of the title.
